# Fuzzy-Logic-based-HR-Analytics
A Fuzzy logic model to understand why best employees, recruited in placements, are not joining an organization. 

This project has successfully been able to the probability of a student joining the
organisation, if offered a job. What factors are responsible due to which recruited employees are
not joining . The factors which are responsible due to which some
students who got placed are not joining an organization have been analyzed and the prediction whether a certain student
will join the organization is made using fuzzy logic. The data set is of about 175 students from my college. The dataset is used to do inferential and predictive analysis. The main focus was to understand what are common features of students who got placed and also who are ready to join (some students donâ€™t join). 

Any company expects that the student, to whom it is offering a job opportunity, is definitely going to join. Fuzzy rule based logic helps us find the probability of a student joining the organisation, if offered a job. So, this will provide any business organization insight upon who is on the risk of no joining the organization and then company can work upon it. Next future scope will focus on our plans to build a more generalized model which can be used by any organization with minimum changes.
