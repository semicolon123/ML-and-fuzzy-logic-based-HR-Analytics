# ML-based-HR-Analytics

A predictive model to identify the factors that influence an employee to leave an organization. 

This project has successfully been able to identify the factors (out of all given factors) that influence an employee the “most” to leave the organization. So we keep in mind only those important attributes and hence our work is reduced. 

Next we were also able to understand which technique is best suited for our dataset. We concluded that Random Forest fits best for our dataset and hence carry on further with this technique only. Then using Random Forest, predictions were made and we concluded at almost 700 employees shall leave the company if current scenario continues and also the employee with, no of projects 3 and time spent in company 6 years, with 0 promotion, medium salary and from sales department, is having high probability of leaving the next. So this will provide any business organization insight upon
who is on the risk of leaving so that company can work upon it.
